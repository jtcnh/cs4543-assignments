Term Project Notes

// Idea:
Potentiometer code lock
Rotate pot to lock / unlock
Using the display to show the digit on the right
Left display shows "L" "U" and "S"


// States:
Locked Mode:
	Rotate pot to select numbers
	Select numbers with SW3
	Reset entry with SW4
	
Unlocked Mode:
	Rotate pot to change between L and S on the right digit
	Select mode with SW3
	SW4 direct to vanduino LED (unlocked ability)
	
Set mode:
	Rotate pot to set right digit
	Left digit shows 1-4 for which digit you are entering
	SW3 sets the entry for the code
	SW4 resets the entry
	
	
// State Transitions:
Locked Mode
	Correct Code -> Unlocked Mode
	Reset -> Locked Mode
	
Unlocked Mode:
	S + SW3 -> Set Mode
	L + SW3 -> Lock Mode
	
Set Mode:
	Digit 1-3 + SW3 -> Set Mode
	Digit 4 + SW3 -> Locked Mode (new code)
	SW4 -> Set Mode (digit 1)
	Digit 1 + SW4 -> Unlocked Mode (return)
	
	
	
// Challenges
	Displaying error / success messages
	Creating a good experience with limited IO

// Process
	Created a new function to write patterns to the 7seg
	DISPLAY_write(int leftCustom[7], int rightHex)
	and other overrides
	Created enum for lock state
	Turning dial and selecting options updates state / internal vars
